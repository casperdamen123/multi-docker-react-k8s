          # This is the only difference between this file and the client and server deployment files.
          # This is because the worker container does not need to be exposed to the outside world.
          # It only needs to be able to communicate with the other containers in the cluster.
          # Therefore, we do not need to create a service for the worker container.
          # We only need to create a service for the client and server containers.
